Annual report R package for CoTC

Welcome to the new and improved CoTC annual report R-package

## Required Software

As these utilities are written in R, you must have [R installed](https://www.r-project.org/).  If you have R installed, the scripts should automatically install the required packages for each utility.  

I also recommend getting R-studio to assist with building packages and just general ease of use.


## Help Files

See the help files in the help folder!

## Instructions If You Do Not Use GIT

You can download all these files by clicking on 'Download Zip' on the right-hand side of this web page.

## Instructions If You Use GIT

Either just download the files as above, or clone to your desktop using a Git client.

If you plan to improve the files, then create your own fork and:

1) Review pull requests (on github.com)

2) Update your own fork (git pull)

3) Work, edit, make changes: (git add -> git commit -> git push)

4) Now your branch is ahead of the original. Go to your repo on github.com, create pull request, send pull request.

## Running the package

Make sure you switch to 32-bit R to use MS Access dbs

After downloading this package from .git press ctrl-shift-b to build it
